Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.


TODO: I feel like this is a sufficient enough interface for a graph because I was thinking of using a hashmap and collections,
to hold the nodes and edges. The nodes are going to be just a collection of strings and the edges will be a set of edges. This is why
I didn't include a node class and why I did inclue an edge class.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?


TODO: My JUnit and script tests differ from each other by each script test will cover a specific case and my Junit will cover most cases especially
the cases my script tests cannot cover.
