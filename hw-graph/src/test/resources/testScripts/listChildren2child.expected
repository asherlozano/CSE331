# listChildren2Child expected file
# tests if the listChildren method can be added to graph
# listChildren lists all the children of n1

# Create a graph
created graph g1

# Create a node
added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1
added node n3 to g1

# Create an edge
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in g1
added edge e23 from n2 to n3 in g1

# Print the nodes in the graph
g1 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in g1 are: n2(e12) n3(e23)
